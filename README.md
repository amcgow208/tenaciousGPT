This project is a chatbot built with the ChatGPT 3.5 API, using Flask as a web framework. Users can interact with the chatbot through a web interface.
Setup - To use this project, you need an OpenAI API key for the ChatGPT 3.5 API and a Flask secret key for secure session handling. Both keys should be stored in a .env file for security and ease of configuration.
Steps to Setup:

1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tenaciousGPT.git
2. Install Dependencies: Navigate into the project directory and install the required Python packages
3. Set Up the .env File In the project root, create a file named .env and add your keys in the following format:
   API_KEY=your_openai_api_key       # OpenAI API key for the chatbot
   SECRET_KEY=your_flask_secret_key  # Secret key for Flask session management
4. Run the Application

Please note the application requires registration as chatlogs are stored and there is also a basic database attached which has been populated with the same data provided to the Chatbot for the purposes of evaluation. 

How the app works:
This chatbot app, built with Flask and the ChatGPT 3.5 API, lets users interact with a conversational assistant, with its primary purpose being to assist employees in completing customer service based tasks.
Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the app combines relevant policy information with the userâ€™s question before reaching out to the API. This way, every response is tailored with the specific context and details users need.
In a nutshell, users log in, ask questions, and the app searches through preloaded documents to enrich each response with accurate, up-to-date information managed through a simple web interface. 
Please review the JSON files included for an overview of what information is inlcuded for the API.

This application was used in my dissertation - Can Large Language Models augment workers rather than replace them? A copy of which has been included.
