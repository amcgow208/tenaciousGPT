Assistant: An early booking is a service that allows you to reserve a product before it becomes available in stock. By doing so, you ensure that the item will be dispatched immediately upon arrival, resulting in one of the fastest delivery times possible. This is useful for securing high-demand items or purchasing gifts for special occasions ahead of time.
