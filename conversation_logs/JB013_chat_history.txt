Assistant: 6. TV installation services are available for LG, Samsung, and Sony TVs; unfortunately, installations for Hisense U8K ULED TVs are not offered.

7. Leading suppliers offering early booking include TechAdvance, HomeComforts, and LeisureGear. 

8. The maximum value a gift card can hold is Â£500.

9. Switching from M140 broadband to M145 broadband would result in an increase in connection speed from 250 Mbps to 500 Mbps.

10. M140, M145, and M150 broadband services are unlimited, meaning there is no usage limit applied to these plans.
